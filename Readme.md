Annonyingly solved Day09 then git nuked my code before my first commit!
Basically created a List<List<long>> from each input line, and each line down till reaching all zeros. THen walked back up the RHS and LHS using the Last/First values on each line and the line above to extrapolate the next value. Added these to a List<lon> and then Summed them!
